## Software

* Web-based front end developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
* Livesplit component developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022
* PDF Viewer and pdf.js develpoed by Mozilla foundation.
  * In additional to the licensing information, the developers requested that if using the default viewer in a project that it at least be re-skinned. This was accomplished by replacing the graphics, changing the color scheme, and changing the background behind the PDFs.

## Graphics

A variety of icons were used from SVGRepo.com, including from the following collections.

* [Dazzle Line Icons](https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/dazzle-line-icons/)
* [Scarlab Duotone](https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/scarlab-duotone-line-vectors/)
* [Solar Bold](https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/solar-bold-duotone-icons/)
* [Travel Duotone](https://www.svgrepo.com/collection/travel-duotone-icons/)

If it seems like a long, eclectic list, that's because it kind of is. It's also because I lost my running list of which ones I actually pulled icons from during this project; rather than leave anyone out, I just listed everyone I saw in my browser history. If I missed someone, it wasn't intentional. Please let me know and I'll fix it!

## Special thanks

* All the cool people at StackOverflow who share their knowledge everyday!
* The speedrunning community, especially
  * Big Jon, who makes everything fun
  * Pidge, for being the coolest person in the business
  * Netara, who is not nearly as evil as they claim to be
  * Midwest Speedfest, The RPG Valkyries, and Power Up With Pride, for having positive, welcoming communities and providing opportunities to play games for charity and fantastic causes.
* Liquid Death, especially the Convicted Melon and Severed Lime flavors. Between that and hyper-focused attention-deficiting, I should definitely lose some weight while staying well-hydrated on this project.
* That guy who seems to work literally every graveyard shift at the local SevLev with all the cool nerdy and fandom stickers on his car. We'd probably have stuff to talk about but, let's face it, we're both in a 7-11 at like 3AM. Neither of us want to be there, much less be acknowledged by other people. You're probably pretty cool, though!
* The Deadlock Wrestling Review series for being fantastic background noise while coding. Seriously, though, if Youtube plays the "David Flair Wedding" episode one more time...I'll listen to it again. What a trainwreck.
* Insomnia
